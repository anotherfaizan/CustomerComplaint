## 🔁 Data Flow

1. User loads form via controller → `ComplaintPage.jsp`.
2. Form submitted → `ComplaintRegisterController` validates and passes data to `ComplaintService`.
3. `ComplaintService` delegates to `ComplaintDaoWrapper` for saving/fetching.
4. Reports are generated by submitting a date range and rendered via `ShowComplaintDetails.jsp`.
